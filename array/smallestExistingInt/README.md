You are given a function:

```javascript
function solve(A);
```

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest integer.

For example,

* Given A = [-1, 1, -2, 2], the function should return -2.

* Given A = [4, 10, 8, -1, 0, -3], the function should return -3.

* Given A = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], the function should return -4.

However, there is a bug. Assuming you are only allowed to update a single line, identify and fix the bug.
